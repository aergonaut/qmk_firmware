This is my personal keymap for the [Massdrop CTRL Mechanical Keyboard](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/massdrop-ctrl-mechanical-keyboard).

## Layers

The main distinguishing feature of this keymap is that there is a separate toggled layer for Windows vs macOS modifier keys.

The default layer has macOS modifier keys because my primary machine is a Macbook Pro.

Layer 1 remaps ALT and GUI into the Windows arrangement. This is so I can use the same board for my laptop and for my gaming PC. Layer 1 is toggled by hitting FN+F1.

Layer 2 is a momentary layer that contains controls for brightness and media keys. It also maps HJKL to Vim motion keys, because I've gotten used to having that mapping available to me.

In all layers I have swapped CAPS with LCTRL and LCTRL with FN. This leaves me with no way to use capslock, but that's okay.
